Homework 2

For each problem that requires a written answer, write (or copy-and-paste)
your answers in this file.  When you are done, you should have replaced all
the ellipses (the three dots) with your answers.

At the end, you will turn in this file along with your modified
dna_analysis.py program.


Problem 1:

(No answers in this file.)

Problem 2:

GC-content: 0.4302926296296296

Problem 3:

Commenting out linenum = 0 caused a NameError on line 38 because
the linenum variable is used to increment itself, and it was no longer
initialized. The same error will occur if gc_count = 0 is commented
out. The variable needs to exist before it can be called.

Problem 4:

AT-content: 0.5689938518518518

Problem 5:

G-count: 5738773
C-count: 5879128
A-count: 7701287
T-count: 7661547

Problem 6:

In every file other than test-small.fastq, the sum of the four counts differs from total_count and the length of seq. It looks like the letter 'N' is popping up here and there in some of the files.
In order to calculate GC content, the sum of a/c/g/t counts should be used as the denominator. The total_count and length of seq include non a/c/g/t terms.

Problem 7:

AT_GC ratio: 1.3223416174746196

Problem 8:

moderate GC content

Reflection:

I learned not to expect that the data set only contains the type of content that I'm expecting to find.  I guess I wish I had known that there would letters other than A/C/G/T in the files.  I would tell future students that the hardest part of this assignment will be using git.
