## Programming Background
I have been using Matlab to write pre-processing and post-processing scripts for
aerospace engineering at work. Python is completely new to me, but I'm hoping that
some of the skills I've learned writing Matlab codes will translate over.  Recently,
I started dabbling into R as well.

## Goals
My hope is that I'll gain enough of an understanding of Python be able to write some
snazzy codes to show off to prospective employers. I'd like to go into data science.
